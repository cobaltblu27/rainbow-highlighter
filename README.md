Paint your code with rainbow-highlighter.  
After coding for a while, I just found out I just can't keep track of multiple variables at once.  

## Features

Press shift+alt+z, and variables curser is on will be highlighted. Press the same command again to remove highlights.  
Press shift+alt+a to remove all highlights.  

(i need to add image later, but right now i'm too lazy)
